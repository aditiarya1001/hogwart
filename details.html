      <h1>About Hogwarts</h1>
      Hogwarts was built in a valley area — surrounding mountains were part
      of the landscape — with the fairly large Great Lake to thesouth of the
      main building. The huge main oak front doors that led into the
      Entrance Hall faced west, and opened up to slopinglawns. The deep
      Forbidden Forest extended around to the west of the castle. There were
      also exterior greenhouses and vegetablepatches on the school grounds.
